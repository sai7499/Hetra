/*
 Pass details of the resource which needs to be managed by the SDK Keystore, along with the an eventHandler which sdk calls whenever a key is generated or available for use.
 
 M360SDKKeyEventHandler primarily has 2 inputs,
    -> M360SDKKeyEventType
 
        M360SDKKeyAvailable: This event indicates encryption key is available for the resource and can be used for decrypting the data. Call to manageResource function may not immediately return the key needed, since sometimes user might have to enter pin before the key is generated. So All code needed for decrypting and opening the resource needs to be invoked on M360SDKKeyAvailable event
 
        M360SDKKeyUnvailable: This event is called whenever sdk has initially had access to the key and now it lost access to the encryption key. This scenario can happen if time for caching the encryption key expires or pin time out expires. SDK app on recieving this event should close the resource since it cannot be decrypted further.
 
 
        M360SDKKeyDestroyed:  This event is called if sdk can never recover the encryption key. In this case SDK app has to delete the resource and request for a new key.
 
 
    -> M360SDKKeyInfo : Key Info object which has the encryption key.
